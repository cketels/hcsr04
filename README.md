Use the hc-sr04 ultrasonic sensor with a raspberry pi

## Description
This project shows how you can use the hc-sr04 sensor with a raspberry pi. The hc-sr04 sensor is an ultrasonic sensor which can be used to measure distances. I use it to measure the oil level in my oil tank for home heating and to measure the water level in my rainwater tank. But you can use if for many different purposes.
